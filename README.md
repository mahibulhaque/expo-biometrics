# Expo Biometrics

Expo Biometrics is a library that acts as a bridge to native iOS and Android keystore management. It allows you to create public-private key pairs that are stored in native keystores and protected by biometric authentication. Those keys can then be retrieved later, after proper authentication, and used to create a cryptographic signature.
